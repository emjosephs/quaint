\title{Calculate Qpc}
\usage{
calcQpc(myZ, myU, myLambdas, myPCcutoff = 0.3, myR = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{myZ}{vector of traits. Not normalized yet.}

\item{myU}{matrix of eigenvectors of the kinship matrix (each column is an eigenvector)}

\item{myLambdas}{vector of eigenvalues of the kinship matrix}

\item{myPCcutoff}{a value that determines how many PCs you want to look at. For example, 0.5 would mean that you would look at the first set of PCs that explain 0.5 of the variation. The default here is 0.3}

\item{myR}{a value that determines how many PCs you want to use to estimate the within-population Va parameter. The default is 50}
}
\description{
This function calculates Qpc given data about the relatedness matrix, and a set of trait values
